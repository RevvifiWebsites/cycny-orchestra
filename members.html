            <p class="info" style="display:none" id="ccinfo">&emsp;A native of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, Mr. Chung began his
              musical studies in piano, violin
              and cello at
              the ages of five and
              nine. Following a successful musical career in high school, he attended the National Taiwan Normal
              University where he
              majored in cello, minored in piano and was awarded the Certificate of Music Education. Upon moving to the
              United
              States,
              Mr. Chung studied under the tutelage of cellist Peter Wiley (of Guarneri String Quartet), at Conservatory
              of Music at
              Purchase College, SUNY, where he received both his Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Music Performance.
              <br><br>
              Mr. Chung's wide professional experience encompasses symphony orchestra and chamber music performances,
              conducting,
              teaching, studio recording and administration. He served as Associate Principal Cellist of the Taipei
              Symphony
              Orchestra, Principal Cellist of the Yin-Qi Symphony Orchestra & Chorus, and the Yin-Qi Chamber Orchestra
              in Taiwan. He
              performed with the Chinese Community Chamber Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, New York Symphony Orchestra and
              the Amadeus
              String Quartet and Piano Trio. Mr. Chung's teaching positions were at the Guang-Ren High School, Xi-Men
              Elementary
              School, and Guan-Du Christian College in Taiwan. He has been serving as the Music Director, cello and
              piano instructor
              at the Song of Songs Music School, Eastern School of Music, Amadeus Conservatory of Music, and Melody Time
              Music Center
              in the United States.
              <br><br>

              In 2003, he was the Music Director and featured cellist for the world premiere of an original
              Chinese-language
              adaptation of A Streetcar Named Desire at the Hwa-Sun Culture Center in Taipei, Taiwan.
              <br><br>

              With Youth Orchestra, CYCNY, at Alice Tully Hall of Lincoln Center, Chung performed Elgar's Cello Concerto

              Shui-Long Ma's
              "Searching" Concerto for Gu-Zheng and Orchestra, with Hao-Yin Huang as Gu-Zheng soloist in 2013.
              <br><br>

              Mr. Chung has long believed that music has the power to transform lives, to transcend cultures and
              languages and to
              bring people together in important and lasting ways. It is for this reason that he dedicates his life
              toward inspiring a
              new generation of young musicians to pursue their dreams through the challenging and life-changing process
              of music
              education.
